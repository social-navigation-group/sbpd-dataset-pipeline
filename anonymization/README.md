# Anonymization (Current)

## Overview
The codes in this folder are for anonymizing videos (Both FPV and BEV videos) and produce automatically tracked trajectories for pedestrians.

To use these codes:
1. Place all the raw videos in the "videos" folder.
2. If you would like to define an area within the videos for producing trajectories individually, run `define_area.py`
3. Run `anonymize_and_track.py`.
